    "description": "## Overview\n\n[org.springframework:spring-core](http://search.maven.org/#search%7Cga%7C1%7Ca%3A%22spring-core%22) is a core package within the spring-framework that contains multiple classes and utilities.\n\n\nAffected versions of this package are vulnerable to Directory Traversal.\nIt allows remote attackers to read arbitrary files via a crafted URL.\n\n## Details\nA Directory Traversal attack (also known as path traversal) aims to access files and directories that are stored outside the intended folder. By manipulating files with \"dot-dot-slash (../)\" sequences and its variations, or by using absolute file paths, it may be possible to access arbitrary files and directories stored on file system, including application source code, configuration, and other critical system files.\r\n\r\nDirectory Traversal vulnerabilities can be generally divided into two types:\r\n\r\n- **Information Disclosure**: Allows the attacker to gain information about the folder structure or read the contents of sensitive files on the system.\r\n\r\n`st` is a module for serving static files on web pages, and contains a [vulnerability of this type](https://snyk.io/vuln/npm:st:20140206). In our example, we will serve files from the `public` route.\r\n\r\nIf an attacker requests the following URL from our server, it will in turn leak the sensitive private key of the root user.\r\n\r\n```\r\ncurl http://localhost:8080/public/%2e%2e/%2e%2e/%2e%2e/%2e%2e/%2e%2e/root/.ssh/id_rsa\r\n```\r\n**Note** `%2e` is the URL encoded version of `.` (dot).\r\n\r\n- **Writing arbitrary files**: Allows the attacker to create or replace existing files. This type of vulnerability is also known as `Zip-Slip`. \r\n\r\nOne way to achieve this is by using a malicious `zip` archive that holds path traversal filenames. When each filename in the zip archive gets concatenated to the target extraction folder, without validation, the final path ends up outside of the target folder. If an executable or a configuration file is overwritten with a file containing malicious code, the problem can turn into an arbitrary code execution issue quite easily.\r\n\r\nThe following is an example of a `zip` archive with one benign file and one malicious file. Extracting the malicious file will result in traversing out of the target folder, ending up in `/root/.ssh/` overwriting the `authorized_keys` file:\r\n\r\n```\r\n2018-04-15 22:04:29 .....           19           19  good.txt\r\n2018-04-15 22:04:42 .....           20           20  ../../../../../../root/.ssh/authorized_keys\r\n```\n\n## Remediation\n\nUpgrade `org.springframework:spring-core` to version 3.2.9.RELEASE, 4.0.5.RELEASE or higher.\n\n\n## References\n\n- [GitHub Commit](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/commit/e3e71ba92a8b82dadf474eda76cd2741f65a77a8)\n\n- [Jira Issue](https://jira.spring.io/browse/SPR-12354)\n\n- [JVNDB](http://jvndb.jvn.jp/en/contents/2014/JVNDB-2014-000054.html)\n\n- [NVD](https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2014-3578)\n\n- [Pivotal Security](https://pivotal.io/security/cve-2014-3578)\n\n- [RedHat Bugzilla Bug](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1131882)\n",

        "description": "## Overview\n[`commons-fileupload:commons-fileupload`](http://search.maven.org/#search%7Cga%7C1%7Ca%3A%22commons-fileupload%22) provides a simple yet flexible means of adding support for multipart file upload functionality to servlets and web applications.\n\nAffected versions of this package are vulnerable to Denial of Service (DoS) attacks. An attacker can upload a file with a long boundry string in the HTTP header, causing high CPU consumption. The `MultipartStream` class contains a flaw that allows remote attackers to cause a Denial of service (CPU consumption) attacks. This happens by setting the length of the multipart boundary to be just below the size of the buffer (4096 bytes) used to read the uploaded file. Typically, the boundary is tens of bytes long, which caused this case to take much longer than usual.\n\n## Details\nDenial of Service (DoS) describes a family of attacks, all aimed at making a system inaccessible to its intended and legitimate users.\r\n\r\nUnlike other vulnerabilities, DoS attacks usually do not aim at breaching security. Rather, they are focused on making websites and services unavailable to genuine users resulting in downtime.\r\n\r\nOne popular Denial of Service vulnerability is DDoS (a Distributed Denial of Service), an attack that attempts to clog network pipes to the system by generating a large volume of traffic from many machines.\r\n\r\nWhen it comes to open source libraries, DoS vulnerabilities allow attackers to trigger such a crash or crippling of the service by using a flaw either in the application code or from the use of open source libraries.\r\n\r\nTwo common types of DoS vulnerabilities:\r\n\r\n* High CPU/Memory Consumption- An attacker sending crafted requests that could cause the system to take a disproportionate amount of time to process. For example, [commons-fileupload:commons-fileupload](SNYK-JAVA-COMMONSFILEUPLOAD-30082).\r\n\r\n* Crash - An attacker sending crafted requests that could cause the system to crash. For Example,  [npm `ws` package](npm:ws:20171108)\n\n## Remediation\nUpgrade `commons-fileupload:commons-fileupload` to version 1.3.2 or higher.\n\n## References\n- [Github ChangeLog](https://github.com/apache/commons-fileupload/blob/b1498c9877d751f8bc4635a6f252ebdfcba28518/src/changes/changes.xml#L84)\n- [Redhat Bugzilla](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1349475)\n- [Apache Mailing Archives](http://mail-archives.us.apache.org/mod_mbox/www-announce/201606.mbox/%3C6223ece6-2b41-ef4f-22f9-d3481e492832@apache.org%3E)\n- [Apache-SVN](http://svn.apache.org/viewvc/commons/proper/fileupload/trunk/RELEASE-NOTES.txt?r1=1745717&r2=1749637&diff_format=h)\n- [CVE](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-3092)\n",

        "description": "## Overview\n[`commons-fileupload:commons-fileupload`](http://search.maven.org/#search%7Cga%7C1%7Ca%3A%22commons-fileupload%22)\nThe Apache Commons FileUpload library contains a Java Object that, upon deserialization, can be manipulated to write or copy files in arbitrary locations. If integrated with [`ysoserial`](https://github.com/frohoff/ysoserial), it is possible to upload and execute binaries in a single deserialization call.\n\n# Details\nSerialization is a process of converting an object into a sequence of bytes which can be persisted to a disk or database or can be sent through streams. The reverse process of creating object from sequence of bytes is called deserialization. Serialization is commonly used for communication (sharing objects between multiple hosts) and persistence (store the object state in a file or a database). It is an integral part of popular protocols like _Remote Method Invocation (RMI)_, _Java Management Extension (JMX)_, _Java Messaging System (JMS)_, _Action Message Format (AMF)_, _Java Server Faces (JSF) ViewState_, etc.\n\n_Deserialization of untrusted data_ ([CWE-502](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/502.html)), is when the application deserializes untrusted data without sufficiently verifying that the resulting data will be valid, letting the attacker to control the state or the flow of the execution.\n\nJava deserialization issues have been known for years. However, interest in the issue intensified greatly in 2015, when classes that could be abused to achieve remote code execution were found in a [popular library (Apache Commons Collection)](https://snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-JAVA-COMMONSCOLLECTIONS-30078). These classes were used in zero-days affecting IBM WebSphere, Oracle WebLogic and many other products.\n\nAn attacker just needs to identify a piece of software that has both a vulnerable class on its path, and performs deserialization on untrusted data. Then all they need to do is send the payload into the deserializer, getting the command executed.\n\n> Developers put too much trust in Java Object Serialization. Some even de-serialize objects pre-authentication. When deserializing an Object in Java you typically cast it to an expected type, and therefore Java's strict type system will ensure you only get valid object trees. Unfortunately, by the time the type checking happens, platform code has already created and executed significant logic. So, before the final type is checked a lot of code is executed from the readObject() methods of various objects, all of which is out of the developer's control. By combining the readObject() methods of various classes which are available on the classpath of the vulnerable application an attacker can execute functions (including calling Runtime.exec() to execute local OS commands).\n- Apache Blog\n\n## Remediation\nUpgrade `commons-fileupload` to version 1.3.3 or higher.\n\n\n## References\n- [NVD](https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2016-1000031)\n- [Tenable Security](http://www.tenable.com/security/research/tra-2016-12)\n- [Github ChangeLog](https://github.com/apache/commons-fileupload/blob/master/src/changes/changes.xml#L65)\n- [Github Commit](https://github.com/apache/commons-fileupload/commit/388e824518697c2c8f9f83fd964621d9c2f8fc4c)\n",

By default, many XML processors allow specification of an external entity, a URI that is dereferenced and evaluated during XML processing. When an XML document is being parsed, the parser can make a request and include the content at the specified URI inside of the XML document.\r\n\r\nAttacks can include disclosing local files, which may contain sensitive data such as passwords or private user data, using file: schemes or relative paths in the system identifier.\r\n\r\nFor example, below is a sample XML document, containing an XML element- username.\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"ISO-8859-1\"?>\r\n   <username>John</username>\r\n</xml>\r\n```\r\n\r\nAn external XML entity - `xxe`, is defined using a system identifier and present within a DOCTYPE header. These entities can access local or remote content. For example the below code contains an external XML entity that would fetch the content of  `/etc/passwd` and display it to the user rendered by `username`.\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"ISO-8859-1\"?>\r\n<!DOCTYPE foo [\r\n   <!ENTITY xxe SYSTEM \"file:///etc/passwd\" >]>\r\n   <username>&xxe;</username>\r\n</xml>\r\n```\r\n\r\nOther XXE Injection attacks can access local resources that may not stop returning data, possibly impacting application availability and leading to Denial of Service.\n\n## Remediation\n\n\n## References\n\n- [GitHub Commit](https://github.com/dom4j/dom4j/commit/e598eb43d418744c4dbf62f647dd2381c9ce9387)\n\n- [GitHub Issue](https://github.com/dom4j/dom4j/issues/48)\n\n- [Ihacktoprotect Blog](https://ihacktoprotect.com/post/dom4j-xml-injection/)\n",

By default, many XML processors allow specification of an external entity, a URI that is dereferenced and evaluated during XML processing. When an XML document is being parsed, the parser can make a request and include the content at the specified URI inside of the XML document.\r\n\r\nAttacks can include disclosing local files, which may contain sensitive data such as passwords or private user data, using file: schemes or relative paths in the system identifier.\r\n\r\nFor example, below is a sample XML document, containing an XML element- username.\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"ISO-8859-1\"?>\r\n   <username>John</username>\r\n</xml>\r\n```\r\n\r\nAn external XML entity - `xxe`, is defined using a system identifier and present within a DOCTYPE header. These entities can access local or remote content. For example the below code contains an external XML entity that would fetch the content of  `/etc/passwd` and display it to the user rendered by `username`.\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"ISO-8859-1\"?>\r\n<!DOCTYPE foo [\r\n   <!ENTITY xxe SYSTEM \"file:///etc/passwd\" >]>\r\n   <username>&xxe;</username>\r\n</xml>\r\n```\r\n\r\nOther XXE Injection attacks can access local resources that may not stop returning data, possibly impacting application availability and leading to Denial of Service.\n## Remediation\n\nThere is no fixed version for `javax.servlet:jstl`.\n\n\n## References\n\n- [NVD](https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2015-0254)\n\n- [RedHat CVE Database](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2015-0254)\n",

This particular vulnerability can be exploited by an attacker by sending a crafted request to upload a file to the vulnerable server that uses a Jakarta-based plugin to process the upload request.\r\n\r\nThe attacker can then send malicious code in the `Content-Type`, `Content-Disposition` or `Content-Length` HTTP headers, which will then be executed by the vulnerable server. [A proof of concept](https://github.com/tengzhangchao/Struts2_045-Poc) that demonstrates the attack scenario is publicly available and the vulnerability is being [actively exploited in the wild](https://www.theregister.co.uk/2017/03/09/apache_under_attack_patch_for_zero_day_available/).\r\n\r\nAlthough maintainers of the open source project immediately patched the vulnerability, Struts servers that have yet to install the update remain under attack by hackers who exploit it to inject commands of their choice.\r\n\r\nThis attack can be achieved without authentication. To make matters worse, web applications don't necessarily need to successfully upload a malicious file to exploit this vulnerability, as just the presence of the vulnerable Struts library within an application is enough to exploit the vulnerability.\r\n\r\n## Remediation\r\nUpgrade `org.apache.struts:struts2-core` to version 2.3.32, 2.5.10.1 or higher.\n\n## References\n- [CVE Details](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-5638)\n- [Exploit DB](https://exploit-db.com/exploits/41614)\n- [Exploit DB](https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/41570/)\n- [GitHub Commit](https://github.com/rapid7/metasploit-framework/pull/8072/commits/fc0f63e77471baa40057effaaa8be0f205adc6b7)\n- [GitHub Issue](https://github.com/rapid7/metasploit-framework/issues/8064)\n- [GitHub PR](https://github.com/rapid7/metasploit-framework/pull/8072)\n- [PoC](https://github.com/tengzhangchao/Struts2_045-Poc)\n- [Struts Wiki](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/WW/S2-045)\n- [Talos Intelligence Blog](http://blog.talosintelligence.com/2017/03/apache-0-day-exploited.html)\n",

The browser unknowingly executes malicious script on the client side (through client-side languages; usually JavaScript or HTML)  in order to perform actions that are otherwise typically blocked by the browser’s Same Origin Policy.\r\n\r\nֿInjecting malicious code is the most prevalent manner by which XSS is exploited; for this reason, escaping characters in order to prevent this manipulation is the top method for securing code against this vulnerability.\r\n\r\nEscaping means that the application is coded to mark key characters, and particularly key characters included in user input, to prevent those characters from being interpreted in a dangerous context. For example, in HTML, `<` can be coded as  `&lt`; and `>` can be coded as `&gt`; in order to be interpreted and displayed as themselves in text, while within the code itself, they are used for HTML tags. If malicious content is injected into an application that escapes special characters and that malicious content uses `<` and `>` as HTML tags, those characters are nonetheless not interpreted as HTML tags by the browser if they’ve been correctly escaped in the application code and in this way the attempted attack is diverted.\r\n \r\nThe most prominent use of XSS is to steal cookies (source: OWASP HttpOnly) and hijack user sessions, but XSS exploits have been used to expose sensitive information, enable access to privileged services and functionality and deliver malware. \r\n\r\n### Types of attacks\r\nThere are a few methods by which XSS can be manipulated:\r\n\r\n|Type|Origin|Description|\r\n|--|--|--|\r\n|**Stored**|Server|The malicious code is inserted in the application (usually as a link) by the attacker. The code is activated every time a user clicks the link.|\r\n|**Reflected**|Server|The attacker delivers a malicious link externally from the vulnerable web site application to a user. When clicked, malicious code is sent to the vulnerable web site, which reflects the attack back to the user’s browser.| \r\n|**DOM-based**|Client|The attacker forces the user’s browser to render a malicious page. The data in the page itself delivers the cross-site scripting data.|\r\n|**Mutated**| |The attacker injects code that appears safe, but is then rewritten and modified by the browser, while parsing the markup. An example is rebalancing unclosed quotation marks or even adding quotation marks to unquoted parameters.|\r\n\r\n### Affected environments\r\nThe following environments are susceptible to an XSS attack:\r\n\r\n* Web servers\r\n* Application servers\r\n* Web application environments\r\n\r\n### How to prevent\r\nThis section describes the top best practices designed to specifically protect your code: \r\n\r\n* Sanitize data input in an HTTP request before reflecting it back, ensuring all data is validated, filtered or escaped before echoing anything back to the user, such as the values of query parameters during searches. \r\n* Convert special characters such as `?`, `&`, `/`, `<`, `>` and spaces to their respective HTML or URL encoded equivalents. \r\n* Give users the option to disable client-side scripts.\r\n* Redirect invalid requests.\r\n* Detect simultaneous logins, including those from two separate IP addresses, and invalidate those sessions.\r\n* Use and enforce a Content Security Policy (source: Wikipedia) to disable any features that might be manipulated for an XSS attack.\r\n* Read the documentation for any of the libraries referenced in your code to understand which elements allow for embedded HTML.\n\n\n## References\n- [NVD](https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2016-4003)",

Rather, they are focused on making websites and services unavailable to genuine users resulting in downtime.\r\n\r\nOne popular Denial of Service vulnerability is DDoS (a Distributed Denial of Service), an attack that attempts to clog network pipes to the system by generating a large volume of traffic from many machines.\r\n\r\nWhen it comes to open source libraries, DoS vulnerabilities allow attackers to trigger such a crash or crippling of the service by using a flaw either in the application code or from the use of open source libraries.\r\n\r\nTwo common types of DoS vulnerabilities:\r\n\r\n* High CPU/Memory Consumption- An attacker sending crafted requests that could cause the system to take a disproportionate amount of time to process. For example, [commons-fileupload:commons-fileupload](SNYK-JAVA-COMMONSFILEUPLOAD-30082).\r\n\r\n* Crash - An attacker sending crafted requests that could cause the system to crash. For Example,  [npm `ws` package](npm:ws:20171108)\n\n## References\n- [NVD](https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2016-4465)",

By manipulating files with \"dot-dot-slash (../)\" sequences and its variations, or by using absolute file paths, it may be possible to access arbitrary files and directories stored on file system, including application source code, configuration, and other critical system files.\r\n\r\nDirectory Traversal vulnerabilities can be generally divided into two types:\r\n\r\n- **Information Disclosure**: Allows the attacker to gain information about the folder structure or read the contents of sensitive files on the system.\r\n\r\n`st` is a module for serving static files on web pages, and contains a [vulnerability of this type](https://snyk.io/vuln/npm:st:20140206). In our example, we will serve files from the `public` route.\r\n\r\nIf an attacker requests the following URL from our server, it will in turn leak the sensitive private key of the root user.\r\n\r\n```\r\ncurl http://localhost:8080/public/%2e%2e/%2e%2e/%2e%2e/%2e%2e/%2e%2e/root/.ssh/id_rsa\r\n```\r\n**Note** `%2e` is the URL encoded version of `.` (dot).\r\n\r\n- **Writing arbitrary files**: Allows the attacker to create or replace existing files. This type of vulnerability is also known as `Zip-Slip`. \r\n\r\nOne way to achieve this is by using a malicious `zip` archive that holds path traversal filenames. When each filename in the zip archive gets concatenated to the target extraction folder, without validation, the final path ends up outside of the target folder. If an executable or a configuration file is overwritten with a file containing malicious code, the problem can turn into an arbitrary code execution issue quite easily.\r\n\r\nThe following is an example of a `zip` archive with one benign file and one malicious file. Extracting the malicious file will result in traversing out of the target folder, ending up in `/root/.ssh/` overwriting the `authorized_keys` file:\r\n\r\n```\r\n2018-04-15 22:04:29 .....           19           19  good.txt\r\n2018-04-15 22:04:42 .....           20           20  ../../../../../../root/.ssh/authorized_keys\r\n```\n\n\n## References\n- [Apache Security Advisory](http://struts.apache.org/docs/s2-042.html)\n",

        "description": "## Overview\r\n[Apache Struts2](http://struts.apache.org/) is a popular open-source framework for developing web applications in the Java programming language.\r\n\r\nThe REST Plugin in affected versions use a `XStreamHandler` with an instance of XStream for deserialization without any type filtering. By design, there are few limits to the type of objects XStream can handle. This flexibility comes at a price. The XML generated or consumed by XStream includes all information required to build Java objects of almost any type. The provided XML data is used by XStream to unmarshal Java objects. An attacker could use this flaw to execute arbitrary code or conduct further attacks.\r\n\r\n[A working exploit](https://github.com/rapid7/metasploit-framework/commit/5ea83fee5ee8c23ad95608b7e2022db5b48340ef) is publicly available and [is actively](https://www.imperva.com/blog/2017/09/cve-2017-9805-analysis-of-apache-struts-rce-vulnerability-in-rest-plugin/) exploited in the wild.\r\n\r\nYou can read more about this vulnerability [on our blog](https://snyk.io/blog/equifax-breach-vulnerable-open-source-libraries/).\r\n\r\n# Details\r\nSerialization is a process of converting an object into a sequence of bytes which can be persisted to a disk or database or can be sent through streams. The reverse process of creating object from sequence of bytes is called deserialization. Serialization is commonly used for communication (sharing objects between multiple hosts) and persistence (store the object state in a file or a database). It is an integral part of popular protocols like _Remote Method Invocation (RMI)_, _Java Management Extension (JMX)_, _Java Messaging System (JMS)_, _Action Message Format (AMF)_, _Java Server Faces (JSF) ViewState_, etc.\r\n\r\n_Deserialization of untrusted data_ ([CWE-502](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/502.html)), is when the application deserializes untrusted data without sufficiently verifying that the resulting data will be valid, letting the attacker control the state or the flow of the execution. \r\n\r\nJava deserialization issues have been known for years. However, interest in the issue intensified greatly in 2015, when classes that could be abused to achieve remote code execution were found in a [popular library (Apache Commons Collection)](https://snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-JAVA-COMMONSCOLLECTIONS-30078). These classes were used in zero-days affecting IBM WebSphere, Oracle WebLogic and many other products.\r\n\r\nAn attacker just needs to identify a piece of software that has both a vulnerable class on its path, and performs deserialization on untrusted data. Then all they need to do is send the payload into the deserializer, getting the command executed.\r\n\r\n> Developers put too much trust in Java Object Serialization. Some even de-serialize objects pre-authentication. When deserializing an Object in Java you typically cast it to an expected type, and therefore Java's strict type system will ensure you only get valid object trees. Unfortunately, by the time the type checking happens, platform code has already created and executed significant logic. So, before the final type is checked a lot of code is executed from the readObject() methods of various objects, all of which is out of the developer's control. By combining the readObject() methods of various classes which are available on the classpath of the vulnerable application an attacker can execute functions (including calling Runtime.exec() to execute local OS commands).\r\n- Apache Blog\r\n\r\n\r\n## Remediation\r\nDevelopers are strongly advised to upgrade their _Apache Struts_ components to version `2.3.34`, `2.5.13` or higher.\r\n\r\nIt is possible that some REST actions stop working because of applied default restrictions on available classes. In this case please investigate the new interfaces that were introduced to allow class restrictions per action, those interfaces are:\r\n* org.apache.struts2.rest.handler.AllowedClasses\r\n* org.apache.struts2.rest.handler.AllowedClassNames\r\n* org.apache.struts2.rest.handler.XStreamPermissionProvider\r\n\r\nIf for some reason upgrading is not an option, consider the following workarounds:\r\n1. Disable handling XML pages and requests to such pages\r\n```xml\r\n<constant name=\"struts.action.extension\" value=\"xhtml,,json\" />\r\n```\r\n\r\n2. Override getContentType in XStreamHandler\r\n```java\r\n public class MyXStreamHandler extends XStreamHandler { \r\n   public String getContentType() {\r\n     return \"not-existing-content-type-@;/&%$#@\";\r\n   }\r\n }\r\n```\r\n\r\n3. Register the handler by overriding the one provided by the framework in your struts.xml\r\n```xml\r\n<bean type=\"org.apache.struts2.rest.handler.ContentTypeHandler\" name=\"myXStreamHandmer\" class=\"com.company.MyXStreamHandler\"/>\r\n<constant name=\"struts.rest.handlerOverride.xml\" value=\"myXStreamHandler\"/>\r\n```\r\n\r\n## References\r\n- [LGTM Advisory](https://lgtm.com/blog/apache_struts_CVE-2017-9805_announcement)\r\n- [LGTM Vulnerability Details](https://lgtm.com/blog/apache_struts_CVE-2017-9805)\r\n- [Apache Struts Statement on Equifax Security Breach](https://blogs.apache.org/foundation/entry/apache-struts-statement-on-equifax)\r\n- [Apache Security Bulletin](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/WW/S2-052)",

Rather, they are focused on making websites and services unavailable to genuine users resulting in downtime.\r\n\r\nOne popular Denial of Service vulnerability is DDoS (a Distributed Denial of Service), an attack that attempts to clog network pipes to the system by generating a large volume of traffic from many machines.\r\n\r\nWhen it comes to open source libraries, DoS vulnerabilities allow attackers to trigger such a crash or crippling of the service by using a flaw either in the application code or from the use of open source libraries.\r\n\r\nTwo common types of DoS vulnerabilities:\r\n\r\n* High CPU/Memory Consumption- An attacker sending crafted requests that could cause the system to take a disproportionate amount of time to process. For example, [commons-fileupload:commons-fileupload](SNYK-JAVA-COMMONSFILEUPLOAD-30082).\r\n\r\n* Crash - An attacker sending crafted requests that could cause the system to crash. For Example,  [npm `ws` package](npm:ws:20171108)\n\n## Remediation\nUpgrade `org.apache.struts:struts2-core` to version 2.3.34, 2.5.13 or higher.\n\n## References\n- [Struts Security Bulletin](http://struts.apache.org/docs/s2-050.html)\n",

        "description": "## Overview\n\n[org.apache.struts:struts2-core](https://github.com/apache/struts) is a popular open-source framework for developing web applications in the Java programming language.\n\n\nAffected versions of this package are vulnerable to Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS).\nThe URLValidator class allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service via a null value for a URL field.\n\n## Details\nDenial of Service (DoS) describes a family of attacks, all aimed at making a system inaccessible to its original and legitimate users. There are many types of DoS attacks, ranging from trying to clog the network pipes to the system by generating a large volume of traffic from many machines (a Distributed Denial of Service - DDoS - attack) to sending crafted requests that cause a system to crash or take a disproportional amount of time to process.\r\n\r\nThe Regular expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) is a type of Denial of Service attack. Regular expressions are incredibly powerful, but they aren't very intuitive and can ultimately end up making it easy for attackers to take your site down.\r\n\r\nLet’s take the following regular expression as an example:\r\n```js\r\nregex = /A(B|C+)+D/\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis regular expression accomplishes the following:\r\n- `A` The string must start with the letter 'A'\r\n- `(B|C+)+` The string must then follow the letter A with either the letter 'B' or some number of occurrences of the letter 'C' (the `+` matches one or more times). The `+` at the end of this section states that we can look for one or more matches of this section.\r\n- `D` Finally, we ensure this section of the string ends with a 'D'\r\n\r\nThe expression would match inputs such as `ABBD`, `ABCCCCD`, `ABCBCCCD` and `ACCCCCD`\r\n\r\nIt most cases, it doesn't take very long for a regex engine to find a match:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n$ time node -e '/A(B|C+)+D/.test(\"ACCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCD\")'\r\n0.04s user 0.01s system 95% cpu 0.052 total\r\n\r\n$ time node -e '/A(B|C+)+D/.test(\"ACCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCX\")'\r\n1.79s user 0.02s system 99% cpu 1.812 total\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe entire process of testing it against a 30 characters long string takes around ~52ms. But when given an invalid string, it takes nearly two seconds to complete the test, over ten times as long as it took to test a valid string. The dramatic difference is due to the way regular expressions get evaluated.\r\n\r\nMost Regex engines will work very similarly (with minor differences). The engine will match the first possible way to accept the current character and proceed to the next one. If it then fails to match the next one, it will backtrack and see if there was another way to digest the previous character. If it goes too far down the rabbit hole only to find out the string doesn’t match in the end, and if many characters have multiple valid regex paths, the number of backtracking steps can become very large, resulting in what is known as _catastrophic backtracking_.\r\n\r\nLet's look at how our expression runs into this problem, using a shorter string: \"ACCCX\". While it seems fairly straightforward, there are still four different ways that the engine could match those three C's:\r\n1. CCC\r\n2. CC+C\r\n3. C+CC\r\n4. C+C+C.\r\n\r\nThe engine has to try each of those combinations to see if any of them potentially match against the expression. When you combine that with the other steps the engine must take, we can use [RegEx 101 debugger](https://regex101.com/debugger) to see the engine has to take a total of 38 steps before it can determine the string doesn't match.\r\n\r\nFrom there, the number of steps the engine must use to validate a string just continues to grow.\r\n\r\n| String | Number of C's | Number of steps |\r\n| -------|-------------:| -----:|\r\n| ACCCX | 3 | 38\r\n| ACCCCX | 4 | 71\r\n| ACCCCCX | 5 | 136\r\n| ACCCCCCCCCCCCCCX | 14 | 65,553\r\n\r\n\r\nBy the time the string includes 14 C's, the engine has to take over 65,000 steps just to see if the string is valid. These extreme situations can cause them to work very slowly (exponentially related to input size, as shown above), allowing an attacker to exploit this and can cause the service to excessively consume CPU, resulting in a Denial of Service.\n\n## Remediation\n\nUpgrade `org.apache.struts:struts2-core` to version 2.3.29, 2.5.1 or higher.\n\n\n## References\n\n- [GitHub Commit](https://github.com/apache/struts/commit/a0fdca138feec2c2e94eb75ca1f8b76678b4d152)\n\n- [GitHub Commit](https://github.com/apache/struts/commit/eccc31ebce5430f9e91b9684c63eaaf885e603f9)\n",

The browser unknowingly executes malicious script on the client side (through client-side languages; usually JavaScript or HTML)  in order to perform actions that are otherwise typically blocked by the browser’s Same Origin Policy.\r\n\r\nֿInjecting malicious code is the most prevalent manner by which XSS is exploited; for this reason, escaping characters in order to prevent this manipulation is the top method for securing code against this vulnerability.\r\n\r\nEscaping means that the application is coded to mark key characters, and particularly key characters included in user input, to prevent those characters from being interpreted in a dangerous context. For example, in HTML, `<` can be coded as  `&lt`; and `>` can be coded as `&gt`; in order to be interpreted and displayed as themselves in text, while within the code itself, they are used for HTML tags. If malicious content is injected into an application that escapes special characters and that malicious content uses `<` and `>` as HTML tags, those characters are nonetheless not interpreted as HTML tags by the browser if they’ve been correctly escaped in the application code and in this way the attempted attack is diverted.\r\n \r\nThe most prominent use of XSS is to steal cookies (source: OWASP HttpOnly) and hijack user sessions, but XSS exploits have been used to expose sensitive information, enable access to privileged services and functionality and deliver malware. \r\n\r\n### Types of attacks\r\nThere are a few methods by which XSS can be manipulated:\r\n\r\n|Type|Origin|Description|\r\n|--|--|--|\r\n|**Stored**|Server|The malicious code is inserted in the application (usually as a link) by the attacker. The code is activated every time a user clicks the link.|\r\n|**Reflected**|Server|The attacker delivers a malicious link externally from the vulnerable web site application to a user. When clicked, malicious code is sent to the vulnerable web site, which reflects the attack back to the user’s browser.| \r\n|**DOM-based**|Client|The attacker forces the user’s browser to render a malicious page. The data in the page itself delivers the cross-site scripting data.|\r\n|**Mutated**| |The attacker injects code that appears safe, but is then rewritten and modified by the browser, while parsing the markup. An example is rebalancing unclosed quotation marks or even adding quotation marks to unquoted parameters.|\r\n\r\n### Affected environments\r\nThe following environments are susceptible to an XSS attack:\r\n\r\n* Web servers\r\n* Application servers\r\n* Web application environments\r\n\r\n### How to prevent\r\nThis section describes the top best practices designed to specifically protect your code: \r\n\r\n* Sanitize data input in an HTTP request before reflecting it back, ensuring all data is validated, filtered or escaped before echoing anything back to the user, such as the values of query parameters during searches. \r\n* Convert special characters such as `?`, `&`, `/`, `<`, `>` and spaces to their respective HTML or URL encoded equivalents. \r\n* Give users the option to disable client-side scripts.\r\n* Redirect invalid requests.\r\n* Detect simultaneous logins, including those from two separate IP addresses, and invalidate those sessions.\r\n* Use and enforce a Content Security Policy (source: Wikipedia) to disable any features that might be manipulated for an XSS attack.\r\n* Read the documentation for any of the libraries referenced in your code to understand which elements allow for embedded HTML.\n\n\n## References\n- [NVD](https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2016-2162)",

        "description": "## Overview\n\n[org.apache.struts.xwork:xwork-core](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.apache.struts.xwork/xwork-core) is a generic command pattern framework. It forms the core of Struts 2.\n\n\nAffected versions of this package are vulnerable to Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS).\nThe URLValidator class allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service via a null value for a URL field.\n\n## Details\nDenial of Service (DoS) describes a family of attacks, all aimed at making a system inaccessible to its original and legitimate users. There are many types of DoS attacks, ranging from trying to clog the network pipes to the system by generating a large volume of traffic from many machines (a Distributed Denial of Service - DDoS - attack) to sending crafted requests that cause a system to crash or take a disproportional amount of time to process.\r\n\r\nThe Regular expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) is a type of Denial of Service attack. Regular expressions are incredibly powerful, but they aren't very intuitive and can ultimately end up making it easy for attackers to take your site down.\r\n\r\nLet’s take the following regular expression as an example:\r\n```js\r\nregex = /A(B|C+)+D/\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis regular expression accomplishes the following:\r\n- `A` The string must start with the letter 'A'\r\n- `(B|C+)+` The string must then follow the letter A with either the letter 'B' or some number of occurrences of the letter 'C' (the `+` matches one or more times). The `+` at the end of this section states that we can look for one or more matches of this section.\r\n- `D` Finally, we ensure this section of the string ends with a 'D'\r\n\r\nThe expression would match inputs such as `ABBD`, `ABCCCCD`, `ABCBCCCD` and `ACCCCCD`\r\n\r\nIt most cases, it doesn't take very long for a regex engine to find a match:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n$ time node -e '/A(B|C+)+D/.test(\"ACCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCD\")'\r\n0.04s user 0.01s system 95% cpu 0.052 total\r\n\r\n$ time node -e '/A(B|C+)+D/.test(\"ACCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCX\")'\r\n1.79s user 0.02s system 99% cpu 1.812 total\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe entire process of testing it against a 30 characters long string takes around ~52ms. But when given an invalid string, it takes nearly two seconds to complete the test, over ten times as long as it took to test a valid string. The dramatic difference is due to the way regular expressions get evaluated.\r\n\r\nMost Regex engines will work very similarly (with minor differences). The engine will match the first possible way to accept the current character and proceed to the next one. If it then fails to match the next one, it will backtrack and see if there was another way to digest the previous character. If it goes too far down the rabbit hole only to find out the string doesn’t match in the end, and if many characters have multiple valid regex paths, the number of backtracking steps can become very large, resulting in what is known as _catastrophic backtracking_.\r\n\r\nLet's look at how our expression runs into this problem, using a shorter string: \"ACCCX\". While it seems fairly straightforward, there are still four different ways that the engine could match those three C's:\r\n1. CCC\r\n2. CC+C\r\n3. C+CC\r\n4. C+C+C.\r\n\r\nThe engine has to try each of those combinations to see if any of them potentially match against the expression. When you combine that with the other steps the engine must take, we can use [RegEx 101 debugger](https://regex101.com/debugger) to see the engine has to take a total of 38 steps before it can determine the string doesn't match.\r\n\r\nFrom there, the number of steps the engine must use to validate a string just continues to grow.\r\n\r\n| String | Number of C's | Number of steps |\r\n| -------|-------------:| -----:|\r\n| ACCCX | 3 | 38\r\n| ACCCCX | 4 | 71\r\n| ACCCCCX | 5 | 136\r\n| ACCCCCCCCCCCCCCX | 14 | 65,553\r\n\r\n\r\nBy the time the string includes 14 C's, the engine has to take over 65,000 steps just to see if the string is valid. These extreme situations can cause them to work very slowly (exponentially related to input size, as shown above), allowing an attacker to exploit this and can cause the service to excessively consume CPU, resulting in a Denial of Service.\n\n## Remediation\n\nUpgrade `org.apache.struts.xwork:xwork-core` to version 2.3.29 or higher.\n\n\n## References\n\n- [GitHub Commit](https://github.com/apache/struts/commit/a0fdca138feec2c2e94eb75ca1f8b76678b4d152)\n\n- [GitHub Commit](https://github.com/apache/struts/commit/eccc31ebce5430f9e91b9684c63eaaf885e603f9)\n",

        "description": "## Overview\n\n[org.springframework:spring-web](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework) is a package that provides a comprehensive programming and configuration model for modern Java-based enterprise applications - on any kind of deployment platform.\n\n\nAffected versions of this package are vulnerable to XML External Entity (XXE) Injection.\nThis is due to not disabling the resolution of URI references by default in a DTD declaration. This occurs only when processing user provided XML documents.\n\n## Details\nXXE Injection is a type of attack against an application that parses XML input.\r\nXML is a markup language that defines a set of rules for encoding documents in a format that is both human-readable and machine-readable. By default, many XML processors allow specification of an external entity, a URI that is dereferenced and evaluated during XML processing. When an XML document is being parsed, the parser can make a request and include the content at the specified URI inside of the XML document.\r\n\r\nAttacks can include disclosing local files, which may contain sensitive data such as passwords or private user data, using file: schemes or relative paths in the system identifier.\r\n\r\nFor example, below is a sample XML document, containing an XML element- username.\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"ISO-8859-1\"?>\r\n   <username>John</username>\r\n</xml>\r\n```\r\n\r\nAn external XML entity - `xxe`, is defined using a system identifier and present within a DOCTYPE header. These entities can access local or remote content. For example the below code contains an external XML entity that would fetch the content of  `/etc/passwd` and display it to the user rendered by `username`.\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"ISO-8859-1\"?>\r\n<!DOCTYPE foo [\r\n   <!ENTITY xxe SYSTEM \"file:///etc/passwd\" >]>\r\n   <username>&xxe;</username>\r\n</xml>\r\n```\r\n\r\nOther XXE Injection attacks can access local resources that may not stop returning data, possibly impacting application availability and leading to Denial of Service.\n\n## Remediation\n\nUpgrade `org.springframework:spring-web` to version 3.2.9.RELEASE, 4.0.5.RELEASE or higher.\n\n\n## References\n\n- [GitHub Commit](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/commit/c6503ebbf7c9e21ff022c58706dbac5417b2b5eb)\n\n- [GitHub Issue](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/issues/16390)\n\n- [Pivotal Security](http://www.gopivotal.com/security/cve-2014-0225)\n\n- [RedHat Bugzilla Bug](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=CVE-2014-0225)\n",

Rather, they are focused on making websites and services unavailable to genuine users resulting in downtime.\r\n\r\nOne popular Denial of Service vulnerability is DDoS (a Distributed Denial of Service), an attack that attempts to clog network pipes to the system by generating a large volume of traffic from many machines.\r\n\r\nWhen it comes to open source libraries, DoS vulnerabilities allow attackers to trigger such a crash or crippling of the service by using a flaw either in the application code or from the use of open source libraries.\r\n\r\nTwo common types of DoS vulnerabilities:\r\n\r\n* High CPU/Memory Consumption- An attacker sending crafted requests that could cause the system to take a disproportionate amount of time to process. For example, [commons-fileupload:commons-fileupload](SNYK-JAVA-COMMONSFILEUPLOAD-30082).\r\n\r\n* Crash - An attacker sending crafted requests that could cause the system to crash.
